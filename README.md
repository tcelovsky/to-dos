# To Do List

This is a To Do list web app built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Backend uses Google's [Firebase Firestore database](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

Styles were created with [MUI icons and components](https://mui.com/material-ui/icons/).

## Running the App

Navigate to the backend directory (`cd backend`) and start Rails server by entering `rails s` in your terminal. Navigate to the frontend directory (`cd frontend-2.0`) and start the server by entering `npm start` in your terminal. A custom Rake command `rake db:dcms` will drop, create, migrate and seed the database with seed data.

## Running the App
